                <h2>My Contributions</h2>
                <h3>Enemy AI</h3>
                <p>I was responsible for developing the enemy AI. I used the Unity Navmesh package
                    to quickly implement pathfinding around obstacles, and developed a finite state
                    machine to handle the various enemy actions. 
                </p>
                <h3>User Interface</h3>
                <p>I was assigned to design and implement the various UI features of Work Inc, including
                    the HUD, with features such as a health bar, ammo counter and wave display. I also
                    designed the main menu, pause menu and settings menu, and implemented features for each.
                    The settings menu featured a volume slider, as well as an adjustable look sensitivity.
                </p>
                <h3>Sound Design</h3>
                <p>I was responsible for recording and editing all vocal sound effects in the game, including
                    enemy hurt sounds, and the voice lines for the vending machine. All sounds were edited in Audacity,
                    and implemented using Unity's built in audio tools. 
                </p>
