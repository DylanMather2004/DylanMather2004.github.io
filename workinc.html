                <h2>My Contributions</h2>
                <h3>Enemy AI</h3>
                <p>I was responsible for developing the enemy AI. I used the Unity Navmesh package
                    to quickly implement pathfinding around obstacles, and developed a finite state
                    machine to handle the various enemy actions. 
                </p>
                <h3>User Interface</h3>
                <p>I was assigned to design and implement the various UI features of Work Inc, including
                    the HUD, with features such as a health bar, ammo counter and wave display. I also
                    designed the main menu, pause menu and settings menu, and implemented features for each.
                    The settings menu featured a volume slider, as well as an adjustable look sensitivity.
                </p>
                <h3>Sound Design</h3>
                <p>I was responsible for recording and editing all vocal sound effects in the game, including
                    enemy hurt sounds, and the voice lines for the vending machine. All sounds were edited in Audacity,
                    and implemented using Unity's built in audio tools. 
                </p>
                <h3>Documentation</h3>
                <p>I authored both the Game Design Document and Technical Design Document for this project. To produce an accurate
                    document it was crucial that I engaged in team meetings to ensure everyone's ideas were given fair assessment before
                    completing the documents. Several drafts were written and evaluated with the team to ensure everyone was comfortable
                    with the design and technical requirements going forward. 
                </p>

                <h3>Admin</h3>
                <p>I was the Product Owner for this project, and was responsible for overseeing Sprint Meetings each
                    week. Our team made use of Jira, and I was tasked with ensuring all team members were assigned appropriate tasks.
                    I worked with the Sprint Leader to co-ordinate the group and ensure all voices were heard when making
                    design decisions. 
                    Each member of the team was required to write their own sprint log detailing what they achieved each week. These
                    logs were then collated into one larger sprint log during each sprint meeting to assess what needed to be done.
                    
                    I was also responsible for working with the technical lead to resolve any potential conflicts in the Github to ensure
                    minimal work was lost in the event of a merge conflict.
