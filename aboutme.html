                <h1>About Me</h1>
                
                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>Hi! I'm Dylan Mather, a Graduate Game Designer from the United Kingdom. I started developing
                    my own games in 2021 and have since gone on to graduate in Games Production at
                    De Montfort university, and release my first game on Steam with my hobbyist group: Balla Games.
                </p>
                <h2>Skills</h2>
                <p>Game Design - I have led several game development projects during my time at De Montfort University.
                    I have been responsible for writing GDDs and TDDs for several projects, and overseeing development of 
                    large games, bringing mechanics, art and audio together to form a cohesive game. I frequently participate
                    in Game Jams on Itch.io, whilst designing larger projects with my friends. I have been accredited for my
                    Game Design Skills, having achieved TIGA Graduate of the Year: Game Design in 2025, for my deck builder game:
                    Balla Battle. 
                </p>
                <p>Programming - I have developed applications using a range of programming languages and frameworks,
                    ranging from small hobby projects in Pygame, to full-scale releases in engines like Godot, Unity and Unreal.
                    I am a versatile programmer, having 8 years of experience developing a range of applications since I started learning
                    to code in Secondary school. 
                </p>
                <p>3D Design - I began 3D Modelling in university, and have since worked on several 3D art projects, 
                    such as 3D animations, and large scale 3D scenes. I primarily use Blender for my 3D modelling projects,
                    however I have some experience with Autodesk Maya, having used the software in several projects at University.
                </p>      

                <p>Audio Design/Engineering - I have recently started to focus on Audio Design and implementation for games, and am
                    currently using Wwise to implement sounds into my games. I have some experience recording foley sound effects, and
                    producing music in LMMS. I am capable of editing sound effects using DAWs such as Audacity, and have
                    produced the full soundscape for 2 games, Work Inc, and Balla Battle. 
                </p>
                <h2>Education</h2>
                <h3>Computer Games Production BSc (First Class Honors) - De Montfort University</h3>
                <p>I studied Computer Games Production at De Montfort University to gain an improved
                    understanding of the entire Game Development pipeline, having previously gained
                    relevent programming experience studying Computer Science during sixth form. 
                    This course taught me several crucial aspects of Game Development such as 3D Modelling,
                    in-engine scripting, Audio Engineering and Player Psychology, whilst giving me the
                    opportunity to perform in a group setting, leading to the establishment of my small hobbyist
                    studio, Balla Games, and the eventual release of our first major project, Work Inc, to steam in
                    2025, with publishing funded by the University.
